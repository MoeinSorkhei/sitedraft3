# Research
<div class="justify">
We are interested to solve problems that lie in the intersection of machine learning and image data, mostly medical images. Recently, an explosion of digitalized data, groundbreaking advances in the life sciences, and the development of cutting-edge algorithms capable of understanding biomedical data, especially from images, have generated terrific excitement around AI and healthcare. Our research revolves around the challenges arising from applying machine learning to medical images. 

The research areas in our group include the following:

- **deep learning for breast cancer risk assessment and prediction**
    A crucial application of deep learning models in medical image analysis is their use in analysis of mammographic images. In our group, We utilize these models to solve problems such as breast cancer risk prediction and its relation to breast cancer.

- **Transferrable deep learning for medical images**
    Transfer learning of deep neural networks is an exciting field in deep learning with the goal of reusing the knowledge learned by a network in one domain in another domain. This has numerous applications in medical image analysis, especially due to lack of data and the cost of acquiring annotations from medical experts. In this regard, we try to investigate and develop models that can effectively benefit from this technique to solve medical image analysis problems more successfully.

- **Domain adaptation and privacy-preserving machine learning for medical images**
    Privacy concerns are of very important when dealing with medical data, since they can potentially leak information about the subjects in a dataset. Moreover, if trained carelessly, machine learning methods can also leak informaiton about the subjects of the dataset they were trained on. 
    Therefore, machine learning methdos need to be developed reliablly to ensure the privacy of the subjects in medical datasets.
