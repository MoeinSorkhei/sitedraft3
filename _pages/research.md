# Research
<div class="justify">
We are interested to solve problems that lie in the intersection of machine learning and image data, mostly medical images. Recently, an explosion of digitalized data, groundbreaking advances in the life sciences, and the development of cutting-edge algorithms capable of understanding biomedical data, especially from images, have generated terrific excitement around AI and healthcare. Our research revolves around the challenges arising from applying machine learning to medical images. 

The research areas in our group include the following:

- **deep learning for breast cancer risk assessment and prediction**
