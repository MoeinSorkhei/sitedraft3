We are a vibrant group at [KTH Royal Institute of Technology](https://www.kth.se/en). We are located at [Science for Life Laboratory](https://www.scilifelab.se/), in the beautiful city of Stockholm. Our goal is to develop better machine learning methods with a specific focus on their applications to medical images.

The problems we try to solve lie in the intersection of machine learning, computer vision, and medical image analysis. Some examples include AI-based mamography image analysis, domain adaptation for MRI images, transfer learning, and generalization. For a more detailed description of the research areas, please see our [Research](research) page!
